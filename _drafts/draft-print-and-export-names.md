There is plenty to say about printing, exporting, file-naming and the processes involved in Revit, but let's keep it simple for now and just identify one "problem" with exporting to DWG and one "inconvenience" associated with printing to PDF. Exporting to DWG is where we run into our "problem." File names seem to be different when batch exporting than when exporting the current view. When printing to PDF, by default, you will end up with long filenames, like those shown below, which are not ideal C:\\Documents and Settings\\eric.stimmel\\My Documents\\00\_Projects\\\#\#\#\#\#\#-Project Name\\Modelname\_LOCAL.pdf
