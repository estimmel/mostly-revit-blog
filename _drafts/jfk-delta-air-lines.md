[Delta Air Lines][] and the [Port Authority of New York and New Jersey][] jointly announced the $1.2 billion project to expand Terminal 4 at JFK Airport in New York today. Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Patterson, among others, were present. I've been working on this project since the beginning of Design Development in February of 2009. At that point we were converting the Schematic Design set from AutoCAD (version 2008) to Revit (version 2009). It has been a long but very rewarding year and half working on the series of projects at JFK. I'm happy to see that it's being announced publicly - we are all excited to see the thing built! ![Delta JFK Gate][] ![Delta JFK Connector][]
