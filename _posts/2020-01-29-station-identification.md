After a nearly five year hiatus, I'm going to revive this blog. I've migrated it over to Github Pages and there are still some details to be worked out, but that's all part of the fun. Stay tuned for updates. 

In the meantime, go out and buy [Mastering Autodesk Revit 2020](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Mastering+Autodesk+Revit+2020-p-9781119570127). The cover image is of the [Moscone Center in San Francisco](https://www.som.com/projects/moscone_center_expansion), a project I worked on for many years. It was completed and opened in 2018. Fun fact about this project - it started in Revit 2012 and was upgraded twice to 2014 and 2015 and hobbled along in 2015 until we upgraded it to 2020 for a study in mid-2019. At any rate, I also served as the Technical Editor on the latest edition of this book.
