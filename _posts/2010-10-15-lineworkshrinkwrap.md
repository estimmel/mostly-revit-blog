Here's a fun little command from the AutoCAD days... `LineworkShrinkwrap` or `_aeclineworkshrinkwrap` if you prefer. We use AutoCAD ADT 2008 at our office, but I think this command goes back a long way (and probably will go forward forever if I know Autodesk). What it does, as you might infer from the name of the command, is create a closed Polyline around the things you have selected. You may not have an immediate need for it, but I can assure you, once you know it's possible you will find an application. 

I don't actually know where the AEC commands are documented (if you know, please post it in the comments), but I have found scant references to it in the [forums][1] and in the [Civil 3D online help][2]. There are other gems hidden in there too such as `AECTOACAD` for those times when you need some help cleaning up a dwg. 

Here's a bonus tip - if you can't quite remember the name of a command in AutoCAD, start typing it on the command line and then hit TAB. You will be scrolled through all possible commands that begin with what you typed... a good way to jog your memory or just see what's available. Also [very telling][3] about the origins of the software.
