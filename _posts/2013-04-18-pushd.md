abstract: A quick way to browse a UNC path on the Windows command line.

Here's a quick one that's more of a Windows tip than a Revit tip, but it can come in handy to someone who manages files on network drives that aren't always mapped to a drive letter. For example, when you need to get a quick list of files from a network folder. 

I learned this from [a Superuser forum response](http://superuser.com/questions/282963/can-you-browse-a-unc-path-using-a-command-line-environment-without-mapping-it-to), but you can find more information on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushd_and_popd) or just a quick Google search. 

The scenario is simple, I'm in Windows Explorer looking at a folder of files and I want to email that list of files to someone so they can comment on it. I could take a screenshot, but I'd rather have text. Normally I would open the command prompt, `cd` to the location and type the following:

```
C:\path\to\files> dir /b > list.txt
``` 
   
This would list the files and folders (that's the '/b' part) and write that to a text file named _list.txt_ which I could then open and manipulate. This doesn't work on a UNC path. Windows tells you "CMD does not support UNC paths as current directories." However with this newly discovered `pushd` command, I can do the following:

```
C:\path\to\files> pushd \\server\uncpath\to\files
X:\uncpath\to\files> dir /b > list.txt
X:\uncpath\to\files> popd
C:\path\to\files>
``` 

As you can see, the first command `pushd` takes the UNC path and temporarily maps it to a drive letter where I can operate on it as a local path. The second command `popd` deletes the temporary drive and returns you to where you were. Simple.
