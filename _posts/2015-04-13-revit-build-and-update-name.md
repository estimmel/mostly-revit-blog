I've been working on a feature of a custom application that displays the current update of the installed version of Revit. The article [How to tie the Build number with the Revit update][buildlist] on Autodesk's Knowledge Network provides a nice rundown of the name (Revit 2015 Update Release 7) and the corresponding build number (20150303_0715). I know this can be found in other places, but since this was recently published and complete for everything I needed, I figured a link wolid be nice.
