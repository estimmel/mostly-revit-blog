For those instances where you have two layered walls (for whatever reason - a small area of ceramic tile or furring that's easier to manage as a layered wall) and need to have a door cut through both, I found this little gem on [RevitCity][]:

> You can use the 'join geometry' command to join the tile wall to the
> base wall and all openings will cut through both walls.

You should check for unintended consequences as always, but it seems to work well in my testing! Thanks to the [Reviteer][] for posting this handy little tip.
