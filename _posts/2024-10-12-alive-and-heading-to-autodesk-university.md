Well It's been 4 years and I bet you thought this blog was abandoned... maybe you weren't wrong and I had to [Google how to create a blog post](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-content-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll)... but here I am and guess what? I'll be joining my one of my colleagues and a number of other professionals in the field in a panel discussion about decarbonizing the buildings and BIM. You can register for the class if you're attending or find out more about it after it happens at the lin below. See you there!
