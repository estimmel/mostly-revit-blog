[David Light][] of [HOK][] has a good article in [the latest AECEdge][] describing the new features of Revit 2011. We've been looking at this for awhile at work - in fact I've just finished creating the 32 and 64 bit deployments so that the office can be upgraded - and it looks to be a great improvement over 2010. Aside from the flashier new features (adaptive components and conceptual massing improvements) I'm really looking forward to the improvements to working with linked models, text, line conversion and the sheet layout tools. We work on some pretty large projects with lots of linked models and managing those projects and maintaining consistency is a full time job. I'm laying the groundwork for a new project that we are estimating will have dozens of linked models... but more on that (and [WAFS][]) later.
