abstract: Quick tip - how to reselect your previous selection. 
---

We've started rolling out Revit 2013 and among [the new features][] is one called *selection sets*.[^fn-rst2012-selsets] There are already many different ways to aggregate objects in Revit which means it is often unclear which one to use. Regardless, I welcome the new addition - perhaps this one will work where all the others have come up short. 

The topic of selection in Revit reminded me of a simple tip that, in my experience, is mostly unknown but beloved by those who do know it. The tip is that *Ctrl* + *Left Arrow* reselects the previous selection. If you have ever spent considerable effort control-selecting a large number of objects only to somehow accidentally deselected them, you can breathe a sigh of relief. 

 [^fn-rst2012-selsets]: Apparently selection sets have been [in RST for some time][RSTselset] - anyone know when they first appeared?
