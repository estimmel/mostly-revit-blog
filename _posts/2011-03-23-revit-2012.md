David Light has a [great rundown of the new features][] over at [his blog][]. There are some flashier improvements such as the ability to add ambient occlusion to a hidden line view (nice!) and some obvious, but long awaited improvements.

I'd have to agree that tagging rooms through linked models is worth the price of admission by itself, but I am also very excited about the UI improvements and the notion of assemblies. The example image David shows is of floors and walls that have multiple, independently identifiable and controllable layers. This has some really interesting implications and I'm curious to get my hands on it and see what can be done.
